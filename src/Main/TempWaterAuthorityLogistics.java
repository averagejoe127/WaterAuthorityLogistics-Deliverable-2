/*
This is the second deliverable for WaterAuthorityLogistics. When you run the program, 
a list of flushes will appear that the user can interact with. The user can view specific details
for a certain flush and alter that information or they can switch to the hydrant table and do the
same tasks. This deliverable of the project does not contain the map view because of a licensing issue
that will be fixed in the final deliverable.
